# Game Design

## Definitions

### 1. Game

`A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome` - Salen and Zimmerman

Elements of a game:
- rules
- play
- outcome

Combinatorial games:
• finite: produce a well-defined outcome;
• discrete: turn-based;
• deterministic: chance plays no part;
• perfect information: no hidden information;
• two-player;

### 2. Ludeme

- a fundamental unit of play often equivalent to a rule
- unit of game information that can be passed from one game class to another
